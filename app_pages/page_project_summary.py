    Farmy & Foods is encountering a challenge with their cherry plantation cropâ€”powdery mildew. Currently, manual verification is conducted on each cherry tree, which involves spending around 30 minutes per tree to visually inspect leaves for powdery mildew. If detected, a specific compound is applied to kill the fungus, taking an additional minute. With thousands of cherry trees spread across multiple farms, this manual process is not scalable.

    To address this, the IT team proposed an ML system to instantly detect powdery mildew using leaf tree images. Given the complexity and nuances of leaf image analysis, we decided to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks.

    - The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves).
    - It contains over 4,000 images from the client's crop fields, depicting healthy cherry leaves and leaves with powdery mildew. Ensuring the quality of the cherry plantation crop is vital to Farmy & Foods' reputation and market position.
